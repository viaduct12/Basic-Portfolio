# Basic-Portfolio

##Description
Basic HTML/CSS on building a website to showcase our coding skills. The website will serve as our portfolio. The website includes a navigation bar with 3 links that links to our portfolio (which all the links are a placeholder), a brief introduction about me, and contact page which allows users to type their name, email, and a brief message.
